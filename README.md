## Overview

The goal of raptorML is to streamline the process of setting up machine
learning projects by automating the creation of a well-organized project
structure. The package asks for a project name and swiftly establishes a
new directory structure for your project. Furthermore raptorML takes
care of the data ingestion and executing of your code by providing
production ready capabilities

This package is designed with the aim of enhancing reproducibility,
efficiency, and code reusability in machine learning projects, helping
you to focus on whatâ€™s important - building and refining your machine
learning models.

Functions:

- `forge()` Creates a directory structure and files for a data science
  project.
- `catalog_load()` Loads a catalog file that contains metadata about the
  data sources used in a data science project.
- `orchestrate()` Manages and coordinates the execution of different
  steps in the data processing pipeline.

## Installation

To get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version, you
can install the development version of raptorML from GitHub.

``` r
# library(githubinstall)
# githubinstall("raptorML")
```

## Usage

As raptor ML create folder structures we cant compile code here
directly. However after the example execution and image of the structure
gives an overview

``` r
# forge()
## creates a folder structure for data science projects and example is in the tests folder
```

## Getting help

If you encounter a clear bug, please file an issue with a minimal
reproducible example on [GitHub](https://github.com/raptorML/issues).
